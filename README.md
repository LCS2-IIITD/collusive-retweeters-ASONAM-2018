Retweet Us, We Will Retweet You: Spotting Collusive Retweeters Involved in Blackmarket Services
```
accepted at The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2018).

# Quick Start

## Requirements

- Python 2.7.x
To install the dependencies used in the code, you can use the __requirements.txt__ file as follows -

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

First ```cd code``` and then run the ```classifiers.py``` as follows - 

```
python classifiers.py -b
```
This will generate results for binary classification as mentioned in the paper.
For generating results for the multi-class scenario, use __-m__ instead of __-b__.
